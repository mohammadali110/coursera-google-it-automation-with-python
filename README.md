## Goole IT Aumtomation with Python Professional Certificate 
[Coursera link for certification](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-automation)

This is a professional certification offered by Google via coursera. As I have enrolled in it (August 2020) and I have decided to document the excercsies given to the course participants in this repository. 

The purpose of documenting the excercises and (thier solutions) is that two fold.
- I may use them for my own refresher down the road
- Someone from developer community taking the same certification course, or learning python, or looking for python excersies in general might find it useful.

I have organised the excercises by course & the week number basis (ignoring week 1, as the excercises were a bit too simple in it). 

I am on course #1 below, hope to continue this as I take this journey.

1. Crash Course on Python (excercises in progress)
- Week 2: (in progress)
2. Using Python to Interact with the Operating System
3. Introduction to Git and GitHub
4. Troubleshooting and Debugging Techniques
5. Configuration Management and the Cloud
6. Automating Real-World Tasks with Python
