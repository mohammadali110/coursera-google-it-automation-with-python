## Week 2 - Crash course on Python 
[Course Home](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-crash-course/home/welcome)

Since the course is designed for first time python and programming learners, the pace is leisurely but every step is carefully planned and crafted. 

Week 1 was about basics of the variables, keywords, data types, operators etc.

The excercises were simple enough to easily solveable in the codepad provided in coursera. Therefore I did not had the chance or need to create separate excercise files.

Therefore only a very few files from this week.
