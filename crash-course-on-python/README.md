## Crash course on Python 
[Course Home](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-crash-course/home/welcome)

If you wish to make the best of this crash course on Python, my suggestion would be to complete the 1 week's worth of course in a single sitting.

For week 1, it took me about a couple of hours & for week 2, it took me about 2 to 3 hours (including all lectures, excercises and quizzes).

The expected time given on course is, lets say generous if you are someone looking to refresh your Python skills.

For further help in understanding or resolving any issues that you may encounter during the course, you visit

Or feel free to reach out to me on git hub, would be happy to help.
