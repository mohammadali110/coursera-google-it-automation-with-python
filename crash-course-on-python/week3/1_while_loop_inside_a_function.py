# Can you work out what this function does? 
# Try passing different parameters to the attempts function to see what it does. def attempts(n):

x = 1
while x <= n:
    print("Attempt " + str(x))
    x += 1
print("Done")
    
attempts(5)

# Solution: It will print "Attemp x" untill the x's value reach the parameter that we have provided.

# Example
# Attempt 1
# Attempt 2
# Attempt 3
# Attempt 4
# Attempt 5
# Done
