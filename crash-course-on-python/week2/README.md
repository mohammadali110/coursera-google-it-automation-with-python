## Week 2 - Crash course on Python 
[Course Home](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-crash-course/home/welcome)

Week two was a bit more complex than week 1. |It is primarily about Functionas & Condiitional Statements.

Since the course is designed in a way that people learning to program can keep up, therefore the content became a bit longer than previous week.

It took me about 3~4 hours to go through the week 2 amterial, including creating these excercise and markup files.
