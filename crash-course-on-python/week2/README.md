## Week 2 - Crash course on Python 
[Course Home](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-crash-course/home/welcome)

Week two was a bit more complex than week 1. It is primarily about Functions & Condiitional Statements.

Since the course is designed for first time python and programming learners, the pace is leisurely but every step is carefully planned and crafted. 

As someone doing a refresher on python, It took me about 3 ~ 4 hours to go through the week 2a mterial, including creating these excercise and markup files.
